You must first install a recent version of 
 - OCaml (at least 4.00.1), and camlp4 (not part of OCaml since 4.02)
   see http://caml.inria.fr/download.en.html
 - GTK (at least gtk 2.10) and Cairo
   if you want codemap and codegraph, the fancy graphics code visualizers
 - SWI-prolog
   if you want the interactive code query tool
 - Java (for bddbddb)
   if you want the datalog pointer analysis

If you want most of the good things just type:

  $ ./configure
  $ make depend
  $ make
  $ make opt

This should generate a few binaries at the toplevel directory such
as pfff or codemap.

If you just want to compile the parsing frontends, then type:

   $ ./configure -novisual

Using docker:

docker run -it ubuntu /bin/bash
apt-get update && apt-get install ocaml swi-prolog openjdk-8-jdk libgtk2.0-dev libcairo2-dev libpango1.0-dev binutils-gold build-essential git
git clone https://github.com/chrissssss/pfff.git
